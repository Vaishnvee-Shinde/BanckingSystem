**Project: Race Migration Process**

**Schema: GSIB_RACE Data Handling**

**Context:**

The Race Migration project involves a process designed to efficiently handle and process large volumes of data within a Unix environment, transitioning to a more advanced system, Axiom. Given the complexity and volume of data, it was crucial to develop a system that not only enhances data processing speed and accuracy but also adapts to the evolving needs of the business.

To achieve this, a series of scripts and workflows were developed. These include data loading scripts (`_gib_race_load.sh` and `axiom_ssibrace.lead.ct/`), and a comprehensive workflow (`pt ssib -> W_BCE`) to oversee the entire operation. Enhancements were made to the data loader to ensure efficient data merging, transformation, and classification, facilitating a smooth transition from Unix to Axiom.

**Action Taken:**

Addressing the challenges of data management in the `GSIB_RACE DATA_STAGE` Table, the team established a robust and automated system. This system involved:

- Crafting specialized scripts for loading and processing data.
- Streamlining the workflow to monitor and execute data handling tasks efficiently.
- Enhancing the data loader to merge and transform data, apply conditional logic, and classify data based on specific criteria.
- Implementing `Feed_Count_Validator` to ensure data accuracy.
- Optimizing data and query performance for Unix environments.
- Consolidating data sources to improve response times and operational efficiency.
- Transitioning to Axiom for greater flexibility and scalability, leveraging its advanced capabilities for improved data flow and processing agility.

Throughout the development, the team engaged in multiple brainstorming sessions, ensuring the selection of optimal strategies for data handling. Rigorous testing was conducted to validate the effectiveness of the system, resulting in a seamless and error-free implementation.

**Benefits/Savings:**

The Race Migration process offers significant improvements and savings:

- Automated data handling processes minimize manual intervention, running efficiently with little oversight.
- Enhanced data management systems reduce the need for frequent storage expansions, offering considerable savings in storage costs and resource allocation.
- The flexibility and scalability provided by the Axiom environment lead to a more adaptive and responsive data handling system, well-suited to meet the dynamic demands of the business.

**Project: Simplified Race Migration Process**

**Schema: GSIB_RACE Data Streamlining**

**Context:**

In the Race Migration project, we're working on making our data handling system better. The big idea is to shift from an older system (Unix) to a newer, smarter system (Axiom). This move is important because it helps us work with large amounts of data more effectively.

**Action Taken:**

To handle this, our team took several key steps:

1. **Developed Data Handling Scripts**: Created special programs to organize and manage our data better.
2. **Established an Efficient Workflow**: Set up an automated system to run the whole process smoothly.
3. **Enhanced Data Processing Tools**: Improved our tools for sorting and refining data, making them more efficient.
4. **Implemented Data Accuracy Checks**: Added a step to ensure the data we work with is correct.
5. **Optimized Performance in Unix**: Made the old system faster and more efficient before moving to Axiom.
6. **Streamlined Data Management**: Simplified how we handle data by using one main source, making everything quicker and more straightforward.
7. **Transitioned to Axiom**: Switched to a more flexible and powerful system, allowing us to adapt better to future needs.

Throughout this process, we focused on brainstorming and testing to ensure we chose the best methods and tools.

**Benefits/Savings:**

This new process brings a lot of advantages:

- It runs automatically, which means less manual work.
- We save on computer storage space and make everything run faster.
- The new system is more adaptable, helping us keep up with changing needs and grow more efficiently.

**Project: Race Migration Simplified**

**What We're Doing:**

We're working on a project called Race Migration, which is all about handling a lot of data more smartly and efficiently. Our goal is to move from an older system (Unix) to a newer one (Axiom) that can do things better and faster.

**Steps We Took:**

1. **Made Special Tools for Handling Data**: We created some special computer programs (scripts) that help us move and organize data easily.

2. **Set Up a Smart System**: We put together a system that automatically takes care of moving and watching over the data, making sure everything goes right without needing constant human attention.

3. **Improved Our Tools**: We made our data moving tools better. They now can mix data from different places, sort it, and decide if it's in the right format or needs changes. This helps us keep our data neat and useful.

4. **Checked for Accuracy**: We added a step in our process to make sure our data is correct and reliable.

5. **Made Things Faster in Unix**: Before moving to Axiom, we made our old system (Unix) work faster and handle data better.

6. **Simplified Data Handling**: We changed our system to get data from just one place instead of many. This makes things simpler and quicker.

7. **Moved to Axiom**: We switched from the old Unix system to a new one called Axiom. Axiom is better because it's more flexible and can grow with our needs. It's also faster and more efficient.

**The Good Stuff That Happened:**

- **It's Automatic**: Our process now works on its own at the end of each month. We don't have to do much to make it run.

- **Saves Space and Time**: Our new system means we don't need as much computer memory space. It also works faster, so we don't have to wait long for things to get done.

- **Ready for the Future**: With Axiom, we can handle changes and new challenges much better. It's like having a smarter system that can grow and adapt with us.
