**Project: Race Migration Process**

**Schema: GSIB_RACE Data Handling**

**Context:**

The Race Migration project involves a process designed to efficiently handle and process large volumes of data within a Unix environment, transitioning to a more advanced system, Axiom. Given the complexity and volume of data, it was crucial to develop a system that not only enhances data processing speed and accuracy but also adapts to the evolving needs of the business.

To achieve this, a series of scripts and workflows were developed. These include data loading scripts (`_gib_race_load.sh` and `axiom_ssibrace.lead.ct/`), and a comprehensive workflow (`pt ssib -> W_BCE`) to oversee the entire operation. Enhancements were made to the data loader to ensure efficient data merging, transformation, and classification, facilitating a smooth transition from Unix to Axiom.

**Action Taken:**

Addressing the challenges of data management in the `GSIB_RACE DATA_STAGE` Table, the team established a robust and automated system. This system involved:

- Crafting specialized scripts for loading and processing data.
- Streamlining the workflow to monitor and execute data handling tasks efficiently.
- Enhancing the data loader to merge and transform data, apply conditional logic, and classify data based on specific criteria.
- Implementing `Feed_Count_Validator` to ensure data accuracy.
- Optimizing data and query performance for Unix environments.
- Consolidating data sources to improve response times and operational efficiency.
- Transitioning to Axiom for greater flexibility and scalability, leveraging its advanced capabilities for improved data flow and processing agility.

Throughout the development, the team engaged in multiple brainstorming sessions, ensuring the selection of optimal strategies for data handling. Rigorous testing was conducted to validate the effectiveness of the system, resulting in a seamless and error-free implementation.

**Benefits/Savings:**

The Race Migration process offers significant improvements and savings:

- Automated data handling processes minimize manual intervention, running efficiently with little oversight.
- Enhanced data management systems reduce the need for frequent storage expansions, offering considerable savings in storage costs and resource allocation.
- The flexibility and scalability provided by the Axiom environment lead to a more adaptive and responsive data handling system, well-suited to meet the dynamic demands of the business.
